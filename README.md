Planning university courses can be a difficult and frustrating process. 
Most programs and degrees require the completion of several courses, and those courses typically require the completion of certain prerequisites and/or corequisites, many of which have prerequisites of their own. 
Furthermore, unlike high school there are many different paths/courses that students can take in order to meet those requirements. 
Therefore it is crucial that students plan ahead, to guarantee that they are eligible for any courses and programs that they may want to take.
To make this process easier, the University of Toronto has a couple great tools such as degree explorer, which allows students to plan out potential courses and notifies them of any issues such as missing prerequisites. 
However, one drawback of UofTâ€™s planner is that it does not provide the prerequisites of these missing prerequisites.
That is, it does not show the entire path of courses required to be eligible for a specific course.
While the student could work backwards by adding a missing prerequisite to the planner and then dealing with its prerequisites, in doing so they may miss a preferred path that they could have taken by choosing a different prerequisite.
Our project question is, Given the desired course that a student wants to complete, as well as the courses the student has already completed, can we recommend the shortest sequence of courses for the student so that they complete all the courses required prerequisites?
